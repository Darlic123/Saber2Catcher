# ‚öîÔ∏è Setup:
## Step 1:
## Get your Discord Token:
### + Open Discord web version!
### + Press Ctrl + Shift + I to Enable Developer Tools
### + Press Ctrl + Shift + M to Toggle Device Toolbar
### + See the >> right next to Performance on the top bar? Click it and choose Application
### + See Local Storage? Expand it and choose discord.com
### + On the Filter bar, search for Token.
### + Copy your token without the " "
## Step 2:
### + Open the Data folder
### + Open config.json
### + Paste your user token into the " "
## Step 3:
### - At this part, you probably (or just now) created a new Discord server for the bot.
### + Remember to redirect Poketwo to your catch channel!
### + I suggest adding Dyno Bot with Action Log (deleted message) on just incase your bot account got hacked. (I lost my shiny Graveler üòî)
### + Enable Developer Mode in your Advanced Discord user setting. 
### + Right click to copy your Spam channel Id and Catch channel id.
### + Paste them into config.json
## If done correctly, your config.json should look like this:
{
   "user_token" : "funnynumberandletter",
   "channel_id" : "number",
   "catch_id" : "number"
  
}
## Step 4:
### + Run ( Supposed you are using Replit to host the bot )
### (Config your run button to be "python3 main.py")

# Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
### - Use only your throw-away account, you don't want to get banned!
### - Hosting on Replit is extremely risky, people can get your token and steal your mons and coins! (I am still finding a way to prevent hacker from getting your token)
### - You can make your bot (kinda) 24/7 using UptimeRobot.com
### + Copy your "https://poke2catcher.yourreplitname.repl.co/"
### + Go to UptimeRobot and Add new monitor
### + Type: HTTPS, Name : Any, URL: The url you' just copied and done.
### + If the bot go off, open your replit page and re-open it.
